# Dependency Injection

## What is Dependency Injection

Inject a dependency (particular implementation) into a class (service).

> Dependencies are normal in application, and the issue is **how dependencies are created and managed**.

## The Spring IOC Container

Spring can create objects and inject them into our classes.

> IOC (Inversion of Control) inverts the control of creating objects and managing dependencies.
